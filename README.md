# Stock Market Trend Analysis 

This project was created by Omar Hemed and it analyzes historical stock data for selected companies (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, and AMZN), providing a clear statistical summary of each stock's performance over a year. This project was built from scratch to demonstrate my ability to handle real-world financial data, create meaningful insights, and visually communicate trends in stock prices.

## Output Description
1. Once you run the code, it will fetch historical stock data for each of the chosen stocks, displaying information as follows:

Daily Stock Data Table: This includes columns such as:

- Adj Close: The closing price adjusted for stock splits and dividends.
- Close: The raw closing price of the stock.
- High: The highest price of the stock during the trading day.
- Low: The lowest price during the trading day.
- Open: The price at which the stock opened that day.
- Volume: The number of shares traded.

Each row corresponds to one trading day, capturing key data that financial analysts commonly use to observe daily trends.

## Statistical Summary for Each Stock: For each stock (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN), the code provides basic statistical metrics:

- Count: Total number of data points (trading days).
- Mean: Average values for the adjusted close, close, high, low, open prices, and volume, giving an idea of typical values over the year.
- Standard Deviation (std): Indicates the volatility of each stock's price. Higher values signify greater fluctuation.
- Min and Max: Lowest and highest recorded values, helping in understanding the range of each stock's price over the year.
- 25%, 50%, and 75% (quartiles): Values at different percentiles, which are helpful for assessing the distribution and central tendency.


This data provides an in-depth look at the stocks' historical performances, allowing trends and patterns to be identified at a glance.
